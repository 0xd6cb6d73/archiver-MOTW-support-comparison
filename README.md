# Comparison of MOTW (Mark of the Web) support of archiver software for Windows

## Background
On 3 March 2022, Microsoft [announced](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/security/internet-macros-blocked) that the default behavior of Office applications on Windows will be changed to block macros in files from the internet (such as email attachment).

An excerpt from the announcement:
> VBA macros are a common way for malicious actors to gain access to deploy malware and ransomware. Therefore, to help improve security in Office, we’re changing the default behavior of Office applications to block macros in files from the internet.
>
> ...
>
> This change only affects Office on devices running Windows and only affects the following applications: Access, Excel, PowerPoint, Visio, and Word.
>
> The change will begin rolling out in Version 2203, starting with Current Channel (Preview) in early April 2022. Later, the change will be available in the other update channels, such as Current Channel and Monthly Enterprise Channel.

This is a great improvement of defense against malicious Office document files.

Whether blocking macro or not is determined based on MOTW (Mark of the Web) attribute of the file. Applications such as web browsers and email clients set MOTW to downloaded files and email attachments that come from the internet. MOTW is set as Zone.Identifier NTFS alternate data stream.

To block macro of malicious Office document files that are extracted from archive files, an archiver software has to propagate MOTW to extracted files when an archive file has MOTW. If an archiver software does not propagate MOTW, malicious Office documents in archive files can circumvent blocking.

A question came up: **"What archiver software can propagate MOTW to extracted files?"** So I tested some archiver software and summarized the result.

## FAQ
- ### What is Mark of the Web?
  Please see these blog articles:

  They are very helpful to understand it.

- ### My favorite archiver software is not listed.
  Please provide your test result from [Issues](https://github.com/nmantani/archiver-MOTW-support-comparison/issues) or [Pull requests](https://github.com/nmantani/archiver-MOTW-support-comparison/pulls). Because I am Japanese, the comparison table contains some Japanese archiver software that you may not know.

- ### How to test my favorite archiver software?
  Please see [Details about the Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW)](https://nolongerset.com/mark-of-the-web-details/). It compares behavior of the built-in Windows unzip utility and 7-zip. You can test your favorite archiver software in a  similar fashion.

- ### Information is incorrect or outdated.
  Please provide the details from [Issues](https://github.com/nmantani/archiver-MOTW-support-comparison/issues) or the fix from [Pull requests](https://github.com/nmantani/archiver-MOTW-support-comparison/pulls). I am happy to fix it.

- ### Can a malicious Office document in a disk image file (such as .iso and .vhd) circumvent blocking?
  Yes. If the file format of a disk image file does not support NTFS alternate data stream, MOTW is not set for the files in the disk image file. Please see also the following:
